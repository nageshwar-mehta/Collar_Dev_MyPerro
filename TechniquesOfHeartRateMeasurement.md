## ‚úÖ Result: Common Methods & Techniques to Measure Heart Rate

### 1. **Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG)**

* **Principle:** Measures electrical activity of the heart.
* **Sensor Type:** Electrodes placed on skin.
* **Accuracy:** Very high.
* **Used In:** Clinical diagnosis, Holter monitors, wearable ECG patches.

---

### 2. **Photoplethysmography (PPG)**

* **Principle:** Measures blood volume changes using light absorption (usually LED + photodiode).
* **Sensor Type:** Optical sensors (usually on smartwatches or finger clips).
* **Accuracy:** Moderate to high.
* **Used In:** Fitness trackers, smartwatches (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch).

---

### 3. **Ballistocardiography (BCG)**

* **Principle:** Detects recoil of body due to blood ejection from the heart.
* **Sensor Type:** Pressure or motion sensors (e.g., under mattress or in chairs).
* **Accuracy:** Moderate.
* **Used In:** Non-contact monitoring during sleep or rest.

---

### 4. **Seismocardiography (SCG)**

* **Principle:** Measures vibrations caused by cardiac activity on the chest.
* **Sensor Type:** Accelerometers.
* **Accuracy:** Moderate to high.
* **Used In:** Wearable patches or chest straps for heart analysis.

---

### 5. **Phonocardiography (PCG)**

* **Principle:** Uses microphones to record heart sounds.
* **Sensor Type:** Acoustic sensors or digital stethoscopes.
* **Accuracy:** Moderate (affected by noise).
* **Used In:** Heart auscultation, murmur detection.

---

### 6. **Impedance Cardiography (ICG)**

* **Principle:** Measures electrical impedance changes in the thorax due to blood flow.
* **Sensor Type:** Electrodes (non-invasive).
* **Accuracy:** Moderate.
* **Used In:** Cardiac output monitoring in ICUs.

---

### 7. **Radar-Based (e.g., Doppler or mmWave)**

* **Principle:** Detects movement of chest or blood using radio waves.
* **Sensor Type:** Doppler radar, mmWave sensors.
* **Accuracy:** Moderate to high (depends on environment).
* **Used In:** Contactless patient monitoring, smart home applications.
